## Usage

These sharded documents can be used independently for specific development tasks or referenced together for a complete understanding of the project requirements and architecture.

Each document focuses on a specific aspect of the system, making it easier to:

- Find relevant information quickly
- Update specific sections without affecting others
- Share focused documentation with team members
- Maintain documentation as the project evolves
