# PRD - User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The application should be minimalist and intuitive, with a single-screen design. The primary focus is on functionality and efficiency, reducing the cognitive load on the user.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

The user will have a single-page workflow: input job description, view generated content, and export. There will be an input area for the job description or a link, a loading state, and a preview of the resume and cover letter. An automatic download of the PDF will be triggered when the generation is complete.

## Core Screens and Views

The entire application will be on a single screen that dynamically changes states:

1. **Input State**: An input area for the job description or a URL.
2. **Loading State**: A visual indicator that the application is processing the request.
3. **Preview/Download State**: A preview of the generated resume and cover letter, with an automatic download of the PDF.

## Accessibility

We'll aim for basic accessibility, ensuring the application is usable with keyboard navigation and has a clear visual hierarchy.

## Branding

The application will have a clean, modern aesthetic with a professional color palette.

## Target Device and Platforms

This will be a web-responsive application, optimized for use on desktop browsers.
