# Mylo James's Application Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Overview

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- To create a web application that interacts with an OpenAI API assistant containing your professional data.
- To enable users to input a job description and receive a customized resume and cover letter in JSON format.
- To allow users to fill in pre-defined templates with the returned JSON data.
- To provide the functionality to export the final documents as PDFs.

### Background Context

Your idea addresses a common problem for job seekers: tailoring a resume and cover letter for each specific job. By automating this process, we're aiming to save time and increase the effectiveness of job applications. This solution leverages the power of a large language model to intelligently match professional data to job requirements, producing highly relevant and targeted application materials. This app will serve as a tool for efficiency, allowing users to focus on the human-centric aspects of their job search, such as networking and interview preparation.
