# Story 1.3: Basic UI with Mock Data

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user, **I want** to see a complete, single-screen UI that displays a sample resume and cover letter using mock
data, **so that** I can experience the application's design and layout before the backend is built.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A single page is created with a clean, minimalist layout.
2. Local, hardcoded JSON data is used to represent the resume and cover letter content.
3. Handlebars templates are used to render the content.
4. The page includes all necessary input fields for the user (text area, URL field) and a "Generate" button, which are
   currently non-functional.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create main page layout (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement `src/app/page.tsx` with clean, minimalist design using Tailwind CSS [Source:
        architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]
  - [ ] Follow the unified project structure for the main entry point [Source:
        architecture/architecture-project-structure.md#srcapp]
- [ ] Create mock data structure (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Define JSON structure for resume and cover letter data
  - [ ] Create local mock data file with sample content
  - [ ] Ensure data structure supports Handlebars templating
- [ ] Implement Handlebars templates (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create `src/lib/templates/resume.hbs` for resume rendering [Source:
        architecture/architecture-project-structure.md#srclib]
  - [ ] Create `src/lib/templates/cover-letter.hbs` for cover letter rendering [Source:
        architecture/architecture-project-structure.md#srclib]
  - [ ] Install and configure Handlebars.js [Source: architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]
- [ ] Create UI components (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Build `src/components/ResumeDisplay.tsx` component
  - [ ] Build `src/components/CoverLetterDisplay.tsx` component
  - [ ] Build `src/components/InputForm.tsx` with text area, URL field, and Generate button
  - [ ] Use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling [Source:
        architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
  - [ ] Unit tests for all React components using Jest [Source:
        architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid-overview]
  - [ ] E2E tests using Playwright to verify UI renders correctly [Source:
        architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid-overview]

## Dev Notes

- Previous Story Insights

  - Builds on Stories 1.1 and 1.2 for project setup and health checks.

- Data Models

  - Mock data structure for resume and cover letter content
  - JSON format compatible with Handlebars templating [Source:
    architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]

- API Specifications

  - No API integration in this story - using local mock data only.

- Component Specifications

  - Main page component: `src/app/page.tsx` [Source: architecture/architecture-project-structure.md#srcapp]
  - UI components under `src/components/` following PascalCase naming [Source:
    architecture/architecture-project-structure.md#file-naming-conventions]
  - Use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling [Source:
    architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]

- File Locations

  - Templates under `src/lib/templates/` [Source: architecture/architecture-project-structure.md#srclib]
  - Components under `src/components/` [Source: architecture/architecture-project-structure.md#srccomponents]
  - Tests under appropriate test directories [Source:
    architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#test-file-organization]

- Testing Requirements

  - Unit tests for all React components with >90% coverage [Source:
    architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#testing-best-practices]
  - E2E tests to verify complete UI flow [Source:
    architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid-overview]

- Technical Constraints
  - Use Tailwind CSS for styling [Source: architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]
  - Handlebars.js for templating [Source: architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]
  - shadcn/ui for component library [Source: architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]

### Testing

- Test file location: Unit tests near components, E2E tests under `tests/e2e/` [Source:
  architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#test-file-organization]
- Test standards: TDD-first, meaningful names, >90% coverage for components [Source:
  architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#testing-best-practices]
- Frameworks/patterns: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E [Source:
  architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]
- Story-specific: Verify UI renders correctly with mock data, all components have unit tests
