# Story 1.1: Project Setup, Testing, and CI

## Status: Approved

## Story

**As a** developer, **I want** to set up a new Next.js project with a complete testing suite and a GitHub Actions
workflow, **so that** I have a robust, reliable, and automated development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The project is initialized using a Next.js starter.
2. Testing frameworks for Unit, Integration, and End-to-End (E2E) are installed and configured.
3. A sample unit test is written and passes.
4. A sample E2E test is written and passes.
5. A GitHub Actions workflow is created to run all tests automatically.
6. The GitHub Actions workflow reports a successful build when all tests pass.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Initialize Next.js project (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create new Next.js app and repository scaffolding
  - [ ] Commit initial project structure
  - [ ] Confirm project runs locally with `npm run dev`
  - [ ] Align source tree to architecture structure [Source:
        architecture/architecture-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]
- [ ] Install and configure testing stack (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add Jest for unit/integration tests [Source: architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]
  - [ ] Add Playwright for E2E tests [Source: architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]
  - [ ] Create `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/e2e` directories [Source:
        architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#test-file-organization]
  - [ ] Add basic config for Jest and Playwright
- [ ] Add sample tests and get them passing (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Create a trivial unit test that passes under Jest
  - [ ] Create a trivial Playwright E2E test that loads the app and asserts a basic selector
  - [ ] Ensure both tests pass locally
- [ ] Set up CI to run tests (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow to install deps and run `npm test` and E2E suite [Source:
        architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#continuous-integration]
  - [ ] Ensure workflow status is green on push/PR when tests pass
- [ ] Add helpful npm scripts
  - [ ] `test` (unit/integration), `test:e2e` (Playwright), `lint`, `type-check` [Source:
        architecture/architecture-project-structure.md#development-workflow]

## Dev Notes

- Previous Story Insights

  - This is the first story in the project. No previous story insights.

- Data Models

  - No specific guidance found in architecture docs for this story.

- API Specifications

  - No specific guidance found in architecture docs for this story.

- Component Specifications

  - Follow the unified project structure for `src/app/page.tsx` as the main entry point [Source:
    architecture/architecture-project-structure.md#srcapp]

- File Locations

  - Place tests under `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, and `tests/e2e` as defined [Source:
    architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#test-file-organization]

- Testing Requirements

  - Use Jest for unit/integration tests and Playwright for E2E [Source:
    architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]
  - Maintain a testing pyramid with unit, integration, and E2E coverage [Source:
    architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid-overview]

- Technical Constraints
  - Next.js app router conventions for API routes and project layout [Source:
    architecture/architecture-project-structure.md#file-naming-conventions]
  - CI via GitHub Actions is recommended for automated testing [Source:
    architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#continuous-integration]

### Testing

- Test file location: `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/e2e` [Source:
  architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#test-file-organization]
- Test standards: TDD-first, fast unit tests, meaningful names, 80%+ coverage target [Source:
  architecture/architecture-testing-strategy.md#testing-best-practices]
- Frameworks/patterns: Jest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E [Source:
  architecture/architecture-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-overview]
- Story-specific: Create minimal passing unit and E2E tests to validate setup (AC: 3, 4)

## Critical Dev Flow

1. **Pull latest main**: `git pull origin main`
2. **Create story branch**: `git checkout -b feature/story-1.1-project-setup-testing-ci`
3. **Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle**:
   - **Red**: Write failing tests first
   - **Green**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
   - **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **Fulfill requirements**: Complete all acceptance criteria
5. **Verify quality**:
   - Run tests: `npm test && npm run test:e2e`
   - Run linting: `npm run lint`
   - Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
6. **Commit and push**: `git push origin feature/story-1.1-project-setup-testing-ci`
7. **Create PR**: Submit pull request for review
8. **Monitor CI**: Use `gh pr checks` to watch CI status and ensure all checks pass
