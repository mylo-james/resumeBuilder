# Story 1.10: Responsive Design and Accessibility

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user, **I want** the application to work well on different screen sizes and be accessible, **so that** it can
be used by a wide range of users.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The UI is responsive and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
2. Basic accessibility features are implemented (keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
